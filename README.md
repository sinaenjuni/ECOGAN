# ECOGAN: Exhaustive COntrastive GAN


**StudioGAN** is a Pytorch library providing implementations of representative Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for conditional/unconditional 
image generation. StudioGAN aims to offer an identical playground for modern GANs so that machine learning researchers can readily compare and analyze
a new idea.
